================================================================================
Project: DTF Drop E-commerce Platform
Last Updated: September 16, 2025

This file contains setup instructions for configuring payment gateways and email
notifications in your DTF Drop e-commerce application.

================================================================================
üìß EMAIL NOTIFICATION SETUP
================================================================================

To enable email notifications for order confirmations and contact form submissions,
add the following environment variables to your .env file:

--- FOR GMAIL SMTP (Recommended for production) ---
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-business-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-specific-password
CONTACT_EMAIL=your-business-email@gmail.com

*** IMPORTANT: Gmail App Password Setup ***
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail account
2. Go to Google Account settings > Security > 2-Step Verification
3. Generate an "App Password" for "Mail"
4. Use this 16-character password (not your regular Gmail password)

--- FOR TESTING (Mailtrap) ---
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-mailtrap-username
EMAIL_PASS=your-mailtrap-password
CONTACT_EMAIL=test@example.com

*** Get Mailtrap credentials from: https://mailtrap.io ***

--- OTHER SMTP PROVIDERS ---
You can use any SMTP provider. Common options:
- SendGrid: smtp.sendgrid.net
- Mailgun: smtp.mailgun.org  
- Amazon SES: email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

================================================================================
üí≥ PAYMENT GATEWAY SETUP

BKASH_API_KEY=your-bkash-app-key
BKASH_API_SECRET=your-bkash-app-secret
BKASH_USERNAME=your-bkash-username
BKASH_PASSWORD=your-bkash-password

*** How to get bKash credentials: ***

‚è≥ Awaiting API credentials and documentation

--- ADDITIONAL PAYMENT SETTINGS ---
PAYMENTS_ENABLED=false
(Set to 'true' when payment gateways are configured and tested)

================================================================================
üö® CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING
================================================================================

*** IMPORTANT: SECRETS MANAGEMENT ***

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: The current .env file contains sensitive API keys
    and secrets that should NOT be stored in version control. This is a critical
    security risk that must be addressed before production deployment.

IMMEDIATE STEPS:
1. Remove .env from git tracking: `git rm --cached .env`
2. Add .env to .gitignore (if not already present)
3. Rotate ALL exposed credentials:
   - Clerk API keys (get new ones from Clerk dashboard)
   - MongoDB connection string (change password)
   - Cloudinary API keys (regenerate from dashboard)
   - Inngest keys (regenerate if possible)

4. Use environment-specific secret management:
   - For development: Use .env.local (automatically gitignored)
   - For production: Use platform secrets (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
   - Never commit secrets to version control

SECURE SETUP PROCESS:
1. Create .env.local file (never committed to git)
2. Copy required variables from .env to .env.local
3. Update all API keys with new, secure credentials
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

================================================================================
üîß DEVELOPMENT vs PRODUCTION SETUP
================================================================================

--- DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ---
NODE_ENV=development

Current Status:
‚úÖ Cash on Delivery - WORKING
‚úÖ Email notifications - READY (needs SMTP config)
‚úÖ bKash backend - READY (needs API keys)
‚è≥ Nagad backend - IN PROGRESS

--- PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ---
NODE_ENV=production

Before deploying to production:
1. ‚úÖ Switch to production payment gateway URLs
2. ‚úÖ Use production SMTP credentials
3. ‚úÖ Enable SSL/HTTPS
4. ‚úÖ Test all payment flows thoroughly
5. ‚úÖ Set up proper error monitoring

================================================================================
üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

1. **IMMEDIATE SETUP (Cash on Delivery only):**
   - No additional setup required
   - Orders work with COD payment method
   - Email notifications disabled (logged to console)

2. **EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS (5 minutes):**
   - Add EMAIL_* variables from Gmail setup above
   - Restart your application
   - Test with contact form or place an order

3. **PAYMENT GATEWAYS (1-2 weeks for approvals):**
   - Apply for bKash merchant account (primary priority)
   - Apply for Nagad merchant account (secondary)
   - Get sandbox credentials first for testing
   - Add API credentials to environment variables
   - Test thoroughly before going live

================================================================================
