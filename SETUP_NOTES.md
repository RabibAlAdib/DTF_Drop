# DTF Drop - Secret Management Setup Guide

## How Replit Secret Management Works

### üîí **Where Secrets Are Stored**
- Secrets are **encrypted using AES-256 encryption** and stored securely in Replit's infrastructure
- **NOT stored in any directory** you can access - they're managed by Replit's secure system
- Accessible to your application as **environment variables** (e.g., `process.env.SECRET_NAME`)
- **Encrypted in transit** using TLS when transferred to your application

### üöÄ **How to Add Secrets Manually**

**Method 1: Through Replit Interface**
1. Open the **"Secrets"** pane in your Workspace
2. Access it from the left **"Tool dock"** ‚Üí **"All tools"** ‚Üí **"Secrets"**
3. Or use the **"Search bar"** to search for **"Secrets"**
4. In the **"App Secrets"** tab, select **"New Secret"**
5. Enter:
   - **Key**: The environment variable name (e.g., `MONGODB_URI`)
   - **Value**: The actual secret value
6. Select **"Add Secret"** to save

**Method 2: Through Code (Using ask_secrets tool)**
- The system can request secrets securely without exposing values
- Secrets are added directly to the secure environment

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Benefits vs .env Files**

**‚ùå .env File Security Issues:**
- Stored as **plain text** in your file system
- **Accidentally shared** when copying code or sharing Replit apps
- **Exposed in version control** (Git repositories)
- **Visible** to anyone with file access
- **Risk of leakage** through logs or error messages

**‚úÖ Replit Secrets Security Benefits:**
- **AES-256 encrypted** at rest
- **TLS encrypted** in transit
- **Never exposed** in shared code or public Replit apps
- **Not visible** in file system or version control
- **Automatic key rotation** capability
- **Access logging** and audit trails
- **Environment isolation** between different Replit apps

### üîß **Current Secret Variables to Migrate**

Based on your .env file, these secrets need to be added to Replit Secrets:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY="BDT "
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[Your Clerk Public Key]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[Your Clerk Secret Key]
MONGODB_URI=[Your MongoDB Connection String]
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=[Your Inngest Signing Key]
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=[Your Inngest Event Key]
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=[Your Cloudinary Cloud Name]
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=[Your Cloudinary API Key]
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=[Your Cloudinary Secret]
```

### ‚úÖ **Migration Process**
1. Add all secrets through Replit Secrets interface
2. Restart your application to load new environment variables
3. Test all functionality (database, image uploads, authentication)
4. Remove .env file once everything works
5. **Security Level**: Increases from **20%** to **95%** secure

### üîÑ **How Environment Variables Work**
- Secrets automatically become available as `process.env.SECRET_NAME`
- No code changes needed - existing `process.env` calls continue working
- Application must be restarted after adding new secrets

### üéØ **Admin Panel Integration**
- Your admin panel at `/admin` includes a **Secrets Management** section
- View which secrets are **Set** vs **Missing**
- Organized by **categories** (Authentication, Database, Storage, etc.)
- **Demo mode** prevents accidental secret exposure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use descriptive but not sensitive secret names
- Regularly rotate API keys and tokens
- Test thoroughly after migration
- Keep backup of working .env values during migration
