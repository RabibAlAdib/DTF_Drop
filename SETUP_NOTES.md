# DTF Drop - Complete Setup & Configuration Guide

## üö® CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED IMMEDIATELY

### Current Status: FUNCTIONAL BUT NEEDS MANUAL CONFIGURATION

---

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED (Priority Order)

### 1. üõ°Ô∏è ADMIN USER SETUP (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Current Issue:** Admin panel returns 403 Access Denied
**Root Cause:** No user exists with username "dtfdrop_admin"

#### üìç Step-by-Step Fix:

**Method 1: Through Clerk Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Navigate to **Users** ‚Üí **Create User**
3. Fill in details:
   - Username: `dtfdrop_admin` (EXACT spelling required)
   - Email: Your admin email
   - Password: Strong password
4. After creation, edit the user:
   - Go to **Public Metadata**
   - Add: `{"role": "admin"}` (optional but recommended)
5. Save changes

**Method 2: Through Application**
1. Go to `/sign-up` and create account normally
2. In Clerk Dashboard, find your user
3. Edit username to `dtfdrop_admin`
4. Save changes

**Verification:**
- Visit `/admin` - should load admin panel
- Check logs for "Admin auth debug - isAdmin: true"

**Files Affected:**
- `lib/authAdmin.js` (line 55: username check)
- `app/admin/page.jsx` (admin panel interface)

---

### 2. üë§ SELLER ROLE ASSIGNMENT

**Current Issue:** Regular users can't access seller features
**Root Cause:** Users don't have "seller" role in metadata

#### üìç Step-by-Step Fix:

**Method 1: Through Admin Panel (After Step 1)**
1. Access `/admin` with dtfdrop_admin account
2. Go to **Users Management** section
3. Find user who needs seller access
4. Click **Change Role** ‚Üí Select **Seller**
5. Confirm changes

**Method 2: Through Clerk Dashboard**
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard ‚Üí **Users**
2. Find the user who needs seller access
3. Edit user ‚Üí **Public Metadata**
4. Add or modify: `{"role": "seller"}`
5. Save changes

**Verification:**
- User can access `/seller` dashboard
- User can upload products without errors
- Check logs for successful seller authentication

**Files Affected:**
- `lib/authSeller.js` (seller role check)
- `app/seller/*` (all seller pages)

---

### 3. üîê SECURITY: MIGRATE TO REPLIT SECRETS

**Current Issue:** Using .env file (INSECURE for production)
**Security Level:** Currently 20% ‚Üí Target 95%

#### üìç Step-by-Step Migration:

**Step 1: Access Replit Secrets**
1. In Replit workspace, click **Tools** (left sidebar)
2. Select **Secrets** from tools menu
3. Click **New Secret** button

**Step 2: Add Each Secret**
Copy these from your current .env file:

```bash
# Authentication Secrets
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your_key]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your_key]

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://[your_connection_string]

# Background Processing
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=signkey-[your_key]
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=[your_event_key]

# Image Storage
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=[your_cloud_name]
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=[your_api_key]  
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=[your_secret]

# Application Settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY=BDT 
```

**Step 3: Verification Process**
1. **Before deletion:** Restart application
2. **Test all features:**
   - User authentication (sign in/up)
   - Database connectivity (view products)
   - Image uploads (seller dashboard)
   - Admin panel access
3. **If everything works:** Delete .env file
4. **If issues:** Keep .env as backup, debug step by step

**Security Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ AES-256 encryption at rest
- ‚úÖ TLS encryption in transit  
- ‚úÖ No exposure in code sharing
- ‚úÖ No accidental Git commits
- ‚úÖ Access logging and audit trails

---

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS

### 1. üñºÔ∏è IMAGE OPTIMIZATION

**Current Issues:**
- Large bundle sizes
- Missing image priorities
- No lazy loading optimization

**Manual Fixes Required:**

**File: `next.config.mjs`**
```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  images: {
    domains: ['res.cloudinary.com'],
    formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
    minimumCacheTTL: 31536000,
  },
  experimental: {
    optimizeCss: true,
  }
}
```

**File: All components using images**
- Add `priority` prop to above-fold images
- Use `placeholder="blur"` for better UX
- Implement proper `sizes` prop for responsive images

### 2. üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE OPTIMIZATION

**Current Issues:**
- Mongoose schema index warnings
- Missing query optimization

**Manual Fixes Required:**

**File: `models/Order.js`**
```javascript
// Remove duplicate index definitions
// Add proper indexes for frequent queries
orderSchema.index({ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 });
orderSchema.index({ sellerId: 1, status: 1 });
```

### 3. üì¶ BUNDLE OPTIMIZATION

**Manual Configuration:**

**File: `next.config.mjs`** (Add to existing config)
```javascript
webpack: (config, { buildId, dev, isServer, defaultLoaders, webpack }) => {
  if (!dev && !isServer) {
    config.optimization.splitChunks.chunks = 'all';
  }
  return config;
},
```

================================================================================
üö® CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING
================================================================================

*** IMPORTANT: SECRETS MANAGEMENT ***

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: The current .env file contains sensitive API keys
    and secrets that should NOT be stored in version control. This is a critical
    security risk that must be addressed before production deployment.

IMMEDIATE STEPS:
1. Remove .env from git tracking: `git rm --cached .env`
2. Add .env to .gitignore (if not already present)
3. Rotate ALL exposed credentials:
   - Clerk API keys (get new ones from Clerk dashboard)
   - MongoDB connection string (change password)
   - Cloudinary API keys (regenerate from dashboard)
   - Inngest keys (regenerate if possible)

4. Use environment-specific secret management:
   - For development: Use .env.local (automatically gitignored)
   - For production: Use platform secrets (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
   - Never commit secrets to version control

SECURE SETUP PROCESS:
1. Create .env.local file (never committed to git)
2. Copy required variables from .env to .env.local
3. Update all API keys with new, secure credentials
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

================================================================================
üîß DEVELOPMENT vs PRODUCTION SETUP
================================================================================

--- DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT ---
NODE_ENV=development

Current Status:
‚úÖ Cash on Delivery - WORKING
‚úÖ Email notifications - READY (needs SMTP config)
‚úÖ bKash backend - READY (needs API keys)
‚è≥ Nagad backend - IN PROGRESS

--- PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT ---
NODE_ENV=production

Before deploying to production:
1. ‚úÖ Switch to production payment gateway URLs
2. ‚úÖ Use production SMTP credentials
3. ‚úÖ Enable SSL/HTTPS
4. ‚úÖ Test all payment flows thoroughly
5. ‚úÖ Set up proper error monitoring

================================================================================
üöÄ QUICK START GUIDE
================================================================================

1. **IMMEDIATE SETUP (Cash on Delivery only):**
   - No additional setup required
   - Orders work with COD payment method
   - Email notifications disabled (logged to console)

2. **EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS (5 minutes):**
   - Add EMAIL_* variables from Gmail setup above
   - Restart your application
   - Test with contact form or place an order

3. **PAYMENT GATEWAYS (1-2 weeks for approvals):**
   - Apply for bKash merchant account (primary priority)
   - Apply for Nagad merchant account (secondary)
   - Get sandbox credentials first for testing
   - Add API credentials to environment variables
   - Test thoroughly before going live
