## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Production Environment Variables for Vercel

### Issue: Mockup Upload 500 Error in Production
**Root Cause**: Missing or incorrect environment variables in Vercel deployment

### Required Actions:

#### 1. Verify Vercel Environment Variables
Go to your Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables and ensure ALL of these are set correctly:

**Cloudinary (Required for image uploads):**
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` = Your cloudinary cloud name
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY` = Your cloudinary API key  
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` = Your cloudinary API secret

**Database (Required for all operations):**
- `MONGODB_URI` = Your MongoDB connection string

**Authentication (Required for seller features):**
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` = Your Clerk secret key (starts with sk_)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = Your Clerk publishable key (starts with pk_)

#### 2. Check Production Build Logs
If uploads still fail after setting environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Functions
2. Click on the failing API route: `/api/customization/mockup-upload`
3. Check the real-time logs for specific error messages
4. Common issues:
   - Invalid Cloudinary credentials
   - Memory/timeout limits exceeded
   - Missing dependencies

#### 3. Test Authentication in Production
The order data fixes require working authentication. Test by:
1. Login to your production site
2. Try to access seller dashboard
3. If authentication fails, check Clerk configuration matches between development and production

## âœ… COMPLETED FIXES (No Manual Action Required)

### Fixed Issue 1: Seller Order Totals
- âœ… Added fallback calculation for discounted totals
- âœ… Orders now show correct amounts after promo codes

### Fixed Issue 2: Missing Order Data  
- âœ… Added complete `shippingAddress` field to Order model
- âœ… Added `estimatedDeliveryDate`, `deliverySlot`, `specialInstructions` 
- âœ… Fixed discount amount and pricing data storage
- âœ… Added order status tracking with history

### Fixed Issue 3: Mockup Upload API
- âœ… Removed duplicate imports causing build issues
- âœ… Added production-optimized error handling
- âœ… Added file size validation (10MB limit)
- âœ… Added Vercel-specific timeout handling (30 seconds)

## ðŸ”„ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### After Setting Environment Variables:
1. **Test Mockup Upload**: 
   - Go to seller dashboard â†’ Customization Admin
   - Try uploading a mockup image
   - Should succeed without 500 error

2. **Test Order Creation**:
   - Place a test order with promo code
   - Check seller dashboard shows complete shipping info
   - Verify discount amount is displayed correctly

3. **If Issues Persist**:
   - Check Vercel function logs for specific errors
   - Verify all environment variables are correctly set
   - Contact support with specific error messages from production logs
