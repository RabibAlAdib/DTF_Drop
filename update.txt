Note:
check console and check if there is some issue. Also Check about some security lackings. Be sure that no activity might effect any other functionality.

Check full codes, and analyse if there is anything missing .. Add all information seperately and create a documentation in update.txt file with all functionality this website have.
At the end add some improvent to make it user friendly including some marketing strategy.
Also add how can i add pixel and connect the website hosting from github--> vercel with my facebook page.
Create every details in the update.txt file so that i can follow your instruction and solve the remain problem manually.

also create a task list for you, if there is any thing to improve now.
